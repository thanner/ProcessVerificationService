    // and client APIs to perform some basic operations.

            // some administrative actions, namely, creating a new database to use for the purpose of this example.

            // Most operations supported by the DBMS require specific permissions, so either an admin account
            // is required, or a user who has been granted the ability to perform the actions.  You can learn
